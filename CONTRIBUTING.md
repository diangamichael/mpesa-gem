CONTRIBUTING
============

Recommended steps when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Make changes i.e. implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Write a failing test to capture existing bug or lack of feature.
5. Check that tests pass locally.
6. Commit changes (see [how to write good commits][1]).
7. Push changes to GitHub.
8. Check if tests pass on CI.
9. Submit a PR.
10. You will get some feedback and may need to push additional commits
    with more fixes to the same branch; this will update your pull request
    automatically.
