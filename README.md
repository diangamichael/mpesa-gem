MPesa Ruby Gem
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itsmrwave/mpesa-gem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itsmrwave/mpesa-gem) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/itsmrwave/mpesa-gem/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/itsmrwave/mpesa-gem)

Basically it's a gem that makes it easy to integrate your app with the new
[M-PESA platform][mpesa-api] dubbed G2 (for M-PESA 2nd generation platform). It
Handles all the SOAP stuff abstracting any direct interaction with the API
endpoints so that you can focus on what matters. _Building awesome_.

The gem [should be up on RubyGems.org][rubygems-mpesa], it's [accompanying API
reference here][rubydoc-mpesa], the [CHANGELOG here][changelog] and [all the
releases here][releases].


Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mpesa'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mpesa
