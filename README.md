MPesa Ruby Gem
==============

Basically it's a gem that makes it easy to integrate your app with the [new M-PESA platform dubbed G2][mpesa-api] (for M-PESA 2nd generation platform). It Handles all the SOAP stuff abstracting
any direct interaction with the API endpoints so that you can focus on what
matters. _Building awesome_.

The gem [should be up on RubyGems.org][rubygems-mpesa], it's [accompanying API reference
here][rubydoc-mpesa], the [CHANGELOG here][changelog] and [all the releases here][releases].

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
